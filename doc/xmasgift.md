# MEMO XMASGIFT

NORD is intended partly as a gift to the VM community. 
On the VMSHARE conference there was a file called MEMO XMASGIFT 
where announcements were posted about such “gifts”. 
The title of this file is a reference to that legacy.

Mainframe virtualization has included a concept of 
appliance virtual machines dating back almost as far as 
virtualization itself. (More than three decades in any case.) 
NORD is well suited to appliance or turn-key or embedded 
on any virtualization platform (or stand alone). 
The S390 build of NORD shares a common system disk among 
any number of guest Linux virtual machines. 

Some URLs listed below may indicate a specific host. 
If for some reason a host is down or decommissioned, 
substitute “www” for that hostname. 

Latest news is at the top of this deck. 

* 2018-January

Moved all documentation from Google Drive to GitHub.

* 2015-December

Finally actually announced the availability of NORDAUTO EXEC and friends.
This follows months of periodic review and updates to the NORD system.

* 2014-December

NORDAUTO EXEC and supporting files (be sure to get CURL REXX)
This script runs in CMS, pulls down a kernel and memory based root FS.
Boots in under 15 seconds, gets the guest on the net and ready to run ‘nordinstboot’ and/or ‘nordinstroot’ if you wish.

* 2013-December

CD0.iso
This CD image has the “rootstrap” packages for I386, S390, and PPC.
Note that GLIBC for I386 is back-level (2.6.1) from that for S390 
and PPC (2.12.2).
