# NORD Source Trust

The chain of trust used in NORD is rigorously short.

With most systems, the user trusts the distributor/vendor 
of the whole package collection. For business this is reasonable. 
The burden of maintaining trust for each package (and of maintaining 
source updates) is outsourced to the distributor as a compensated 
third party. Companies can purchase support to create a legal relationship, 
assigning the risk of trust (and other risks) to the distributor. 

NORD is FOSS based, so it instead has a trust relationship with each 
package author/maintainer. When you use either CSCRATCH or /usr/opt 
Chicory, you go direct in trusting each package publisher. 
The effort gives you more control. 


## Your Mission, ... 

Both CSCRATCH and /usr/opt Chicory support vetting of source archives. 
For those sources which are signed by their publisher, the build logic 
will check the signature. 

It's up to you to acquire and verify the signing keys. 


## ... should you choose to accept it

A collection of source package signing keys is part of the NORD hierarchy. 
See the contents on Github.

Check them out for yourself. Confirm their validity.

Note: both CSCRATCH and /usr/opt Chicory can be employed on other 
systems besides NORD. This means that NORDâ€™s trust store can be applied 
to any Linux distribution, as well as to FreeBSD, OpenBSD, OS X / Darwin, 
even CYGWIN and Minix.
